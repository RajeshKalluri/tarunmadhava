                  Money touches every corner of our lives — our dreams, our families, our choices, and our future. Yet, for most people, financial education isn’t something we’re taught; it’s something we stumble upon through trial, error, and sometimes painful lessons.
                </p>

                <p className="text-[#002E5B] pt-6 text-sm text-semibold">
                  That’s why I believe financial education should be a birthright, not a luxury. Every family deserves clarity, confidence, and the freedom that comes from truly understanding how money works. Because when families build strong financial foundations, they don’t just change their own lives — they transform entire communities for generations to come.

                  When I founded <strong>Munna LLC (Mandava Financial Services)</strong>, I had a simple yet powerful mission in mind:

                  This vision goes beyond numbers and charts. It’s about people — hardworking families striving to build a better life, parents thinking about their children’s future, and individuals seeking peace of mind knowing that they’re prepared for whatever life brings.

                  Throughout my years as a financial educator, entrepreneur, and business leader, I’ve seen one constant truth: most people don’t need more complicated financial products — they need better understanding.
                </p>
                <p className="text-[#002E5B] pt-6 text-sm text-semibold">
                  Every strategy I share is grounded in simplicity and practicality — not Wall Street jargon. Instead, I focus on real-world financial principles designed to:

                  From IT Professional to Financial Mentor: A Journey of Purpose
                </h1>
                <p className="text-[#002E5B] pt-6 text-sm text-semibold">
                  Before entering financial services, I spent over two decades in <strong>Information Technology (IT)</strong> — a field where precision, analysis, and problem-solving are essential. Along the way, I earned an <strong>MBA</strong> and a <strong>Master’s in Business Analytics</strong>.
                </p>
                <p className="text-[#002E5B] pt-6 text-sm text-semibold">
                  While I found great success in IT, I noticed that many professionals struggled to make sense of their personal finances. They were experts in their careers but often unsure how to build long-term financial security. That realization sparked a new purpose — to merge my analytical background with my passion for teaching financial literacy.
                </p>
                <p className="text-[#002E5B] pt-6 text-sm text-semibold">
                  Today, as a <strong>Certified Tax & Business Advisor (CTBA)</strong>, I specialize in tax-efficient planning, wealth transfer, and business solutions that empower families to keep more of what they earn and pass on a stronger legacy to the next generation.

                <p className="text-[#002E5B] pt-6 text-sm text-semibold">
                  One of the most rewarding aspects of my journey has been mentoring aspiring financial professionals. I’ve trained and inspired individuals to pursue fulfilling careers in financial services — empowering them to achieve both financial independence and personal growth.

                <p className="text-[#002E5B] pt-6 text-sm text-semibold">
                  Leadership, to me, is about service. It’s about helping others rise — guiding them to build not only their businesses but also their confidence, purpose, and sense of impact.

                  More Than Money: Defining True Wealth
                </h1>
                <p className="text-[#002E5B] pt-6 text-sm text-semibold">
                  I believe that true wealth isn’t measured in dollars — it’s measured in the impact we leave behind. It’s the lessons we teach our children, the opportunities we create, and the values we pass down through generations.
                </p>
                <p className="text-[#002E5B] pt-6 text-sm text-semibold">
                  Financial success means little without fulfillment and purpose. That’s why every plan I design circles back to one question:
